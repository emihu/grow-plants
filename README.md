# Grow Plants

A plant growing animation written in C and connected to a DE1-SoC computer system.
May be simulated on the [CPUlator Computer System Simulator](https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm-de1soc).

## Features
The animation is displayed on the VGA and can be interacted with using the push keys on the DE1-SoC board and mouse clicks with the PS/2. 

KEY0 clears all the plants on the screen.
KEY1 pauses the plant growth; clicking once will stop the growth and clicking again resumes it. 
KEY2 changes the speed of the plant growth; pushing this button loops through three preset speeds. 
KEY3 changes the colours of the plants.

Clicking on the screen with the mouse begins growing a new plant at the location of the mouse click.
